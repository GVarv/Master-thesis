# Identification of exceptional origination hotspots in the NOW database of fossil mammals
## Proposal


In the last few decades large collections of fossil records have been put together. This availability of large amount of fossil data has allowed the use of computational and statistical techniques to analyze the change and dynamics in the faunal communities that have existed throughout the different time periods.
Using the fossil records it is possible to see that new species arise all the time in different places and times, and in the same way they also go extinct. It is also possible to notice that there are some points in space and time that give rise to an abnormal rate of new species. These places can be called species factories and are the focus of this thesis.

In this thesis we will focus on the NOW database of fossil mammals, which contains information about Cenozoic land mammal taxa and their localities.
This database can be used to compute origination rates and analyze when and where species have appeared for the first time, and which proportion of new species is present at a given point in time and space.

The main issue with fossil records is the uneven sampling effort among locations, due to different reasons (different rates of preservation of different environments, different exposure of fossils in different layers, making some time periods less sampled than others, etc.). This could create biased speciation rate since in better sampled locations there is a higher probability to find a larger number of new species, leading to inflated origination rates.
Different methods can be employed to deal with uneven sampling across locations. Several studies have used the Capture-Mark-Recapture methods, borrowed from ecology and adapted to the fossil records. These methods will be the starting point also in this thesis to account for uneven sampling.

Once this uneven sampling is accounted for, the next step would be to design a test to measure which locations in space and time have abnormal origination rates and can be identified as species factories.
This would enable comparing the spread and survival of the species originated there with the ones originated in the rest of the locations, to see if the species originated in the species factories seem to be more successful than the others.
